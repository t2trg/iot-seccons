       IoT Security - Threats, Security mitigations and Profiles
             draft-garcia-security-mitigations-and-profiles

Abstract

   The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard
   Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing
   communication.  The security needs are well-recognized and and many
   standardization steps for providing security have been taken, for
   example, the specification of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
   over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  However, the design
   space of IoT applications and systems is complex and exposed to
   multiple types of threats.

   This document summarizes key security threats and suitable mitigation
   strategies to protect against these threats.  We introduce the
   concept of security profiles, sets of security mitigations applicable
   to IoT applications and systems exposed to similar security threats.

Internet-Draft                IoT Security                 December 2018


2.  Introduction

   The Internet of Things (IoT) denotes the interconnection of highly
   heterogeneous networked entities and networks following a number of
   communication patterns such as: human-to-human (H2H), human-to-thing
   (H2T), thing-to-thing (T2T), or thing-to-things (T2Ts).  The term IoT
   was first coined by the Auto-ID center [AUTO-ID] in 1999.  Since
   then, the development of the underlying concepts has ever increased
   its pace.  Nowadays, the IoT presents a strong focus of research with
   various initiatives working on the (re)design, application, and usage
   of standard Internet technology in the IoT.

   The IoT is exposed to a high number of attack vectors, that if
   sucessfully exploited by an attacker can have severe consequences.
   This document summarizes threats and existing mitigation strategies
   to overcome those threats.  Which mitigation strategies are most
   suitable to and required in an IoT system depends on several factors,
   including, the operational features of the IoT system or the threats
   that are applicable to that system.  Thus, this document further
   discusses processes that can facilitate the proper design and
   operation of secure IoT systems.  Finally, this document proposes
   diffent security profiles, i.e., sets of mitigation strategies, that
   address typical threats in different IoT environments.

   The rest of the Internet-Draft is organized as follows.
   Section Section 3 summarizes the design space of secure IoT systems,
   including lifecycle, device capabilities, and operational features.
   This section further gives general definitions for the main security
   building blocks within the IoT domain.  Section Section 4 discusses
   threats that should be considered when designing and operating an IoT
   system.  In Section 5, mitigation strategies to the identified
   threats are listed.  Choosing which mitigation strategies apply to
   which use cases is not trivial since it is required to find a proper
   balance between security, cost and usuability.  Thus, the following
   section details methodologies for managing risks when designing a
   secure IoT system and dealing with vulnerabilities when operating the
   system.  Finally, Section 7 proposes a number of illustrative
   security profiles applicable to different illustrative clases of IoT
   systems.  Each security profile comprises a set of mitigation
   strategies and security processes that can provide a suitable
   security level while matching the cost and usuability goals of the
   corresponding class of IoT systems.  Section 8 includes final remarks
   and conclusions.

   The lifecycle of a thing refers to the operational phases of a thing
   in the context of a given application or use case.  Figure 1 shows
   the generic phases of the lifecycle of a thing.  This generic
   lifecycle is applicable to very different IoT applications and
   scenarios.

   We consider an example, a Building Automation and Control (BAC)
   system, to illustrate the lifecycle and the meaning of these
   different phases.  A BAC system consists of a network of
   interconnected nodes that performs various functions in the domains
   of HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning), lighting,
   safety etc.  The nodes vary in functionality and a majority of them
   represent resource constrained devices such as sensors and
   luminaries.  Some devices may also be battery operated or battery-
   less nodes, demanding for a focus on low energy consumption and on
   sleeping devices.  In our example, the life of a thing starts when it
   is manufactured.  Due to the different application areas (i.e., HVAC,
   lighting, safety) nodes are tailored to a specific task.  It is
   therefore unlikely that one single manufacturer will create all nodes
   in a building.  Hence, interoperability as well as trust
   bootstrapping between nodes of different vendors is important.  The
   thing is later installed and commissioned within a network by an
   installer during the bootstrapping phase.  Specifically, the device
   identity and the secret keys used during normal operation are
   provided to the device during this phase.  Different subcontractors
   may install different IoT devices for different purposes.
   Furthermore, the installation and bootstrapping procedures may not be
   a defined event but may stretch over an extended period of time.
   After being bootstrapped, the device and the system of things are in
   operational mode and execute the functions of the BAC system.  During
   this operational phase, the device is under the control of the system
   owner.  For devices with lifetimes spanning several years, occasional
   maintenance cycles may be required.  During each maintenance phase,
   the software on the device can be upgraded or applications running on
   the device can be reconfigured.  The maintenance tasks can thereby be
   performed either locally or from a backend system by means of an end-
   to-end connection.  Depending on the operational changes of the
   device, it may be required to re-bootstrap at the end of a
   maintenance cycle.  The device continues to loop through the
   operational phase and the eventual maintenance phase until the device
   is decommissioned at the end of its lifecycle.  However, the end-of-
   life of a device does not necessarily mean that it is defective but
   rather denotes a need to replace and upgrade the network to next-
   generation devices in order to provide additional functionality.
   Therefore the device can be removed and re-commissioned to be used in
   a different system under a different owner by starting the lifecycle
   all over again.

Internet-Draft                IoT Security                 December 2018


   This section explores security threats and vulnerabilities in the IoT
   and discusses how to manage risks.

   Security threats have been analyzed in related IP protocols including
   HTTPS [RFC2818], COAP[RFC7252] 6LoWPAN [RFC4919], ANCP [RFC5713], DNS
   security threats [RFC3833], SIP [RFC3261], IPv6 ND [RFC3756], and
   PANA [RFC4016].  Nonetheless, the challenge is about their impacts on
   scenarios of the IoTs.  In this section, we specifically discuss the
   threats that could compromise an individual thing, or network as a
   whole.  Note that these set of threats might go beyond the scope of
   Internet protocols but we gather them here for the sake of
   completeness.  We also note that these threats can be classified
   according to either (i) the thing's lifecycle phases (when does the
   threat occur?) or (ii) the security building blocks (which
   functionality is affected by the threat?).  All these threats are
   summarized in Table 2.

   1.  Cloning of things: During the manufacturing process of a thing,
       an untrusted factory can easily clone the physical
       characteristics, firmware/software, or security configuration of
       the thing.  Deployed things might also be compromised and their
       software reserve engineered allowing for cloning or software
       modifications.  Such a cloned thing may be sold at a cheaper
       price in the market, and yet be able to function normally, as a
       genuine thing.  For example, two cloned devices can still be
       associated and work with each other.  In the worst case scenario,
       a cloned device can be used to control a genuine device or
       perform an attack.  One should note here, that an untrusted
       factory may also change functionality of the cloned thing,
       resulting in degraded functionality with respect to the genuine
       thing (thereby, inflicting potential damage to the reputation of
       the original thing manufacturer).  Moreover, additional
       functionality can be implemented within the cloned thing, such as
       a backdoor.

   2.  Malicious substitution of things: During the installation of a
       thing, a genuine thing may be substituted with a similar variant
       of lower quality without being detected.  The main motivation may
       be cost savings, where the installation of lower-quality things
       (e.g., non-certified products) may significantly reduce the
       installation and operational costs.  The installers can
       subsequently resell the genuine things in order to gain further
       financial benefits.  Another motivation may be to inflict damage
       to the reputation of a competitor's offerings.

   3.  Eavesdropping attack: During the commissioning of a thing into a
       network, it may be susceptible to eavesdropping, especially if
       operational keying materials, security parameters, or



Garcia-Morchon, et al.    Expires June 15, 2019                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                IoT Security                 December 2018


       configuration settings, are exchanged in clear using a wireless
       medium or if used cryptographic algorithms are not suitable for
       the envisioned lifetime of the device and the system.  After
       obtaining the keying material, the attacker might be able to
       recover the secret keys established between the communicating
       entities (e.g., H2T, T2Ts, or Thing to the backend management
       system), thereby compromising the authenticity and
       confidentiality of the communication channel, as well as the
       authenticity of commands and other traffic exchanged over this
       communication channel.  When the network is in operation, T2T
       communication may be eavesdropped upon if the communication
       channel is not sufficiently protected or in the event of session
       key compromise due to a long period of usage without key renewal
       or updates.

   4.  Man-in-the-middle attack: Both the commissioning phase and
       operational phases may also be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
       attacks, e.g., when keying material between communicating
       entities are exchanged in the clear and the security of the key
       establishment protocol depends on the tacit assumption that no
       third party is able to eavesdrop during the execution of this
       protocol.  Additionally, device authentication or device
       authorization may be non-trivial, or may need support of a human
       decision process, since things usually do not have a-priori
       knowledge about each other and cannot always be able to
       differentiate friends and foes via completely automated
       mechanisms.  Thus, even if the key establishment protocol
       provides cryptographic device authentication, this knowledge on
       device identities may still need complementing with a human-
       assisted authorization step (thereby, presenting a weak link and
       offering the potential of man-in-the-middle attacks this way).

   5.  Firmware Replacement attack: When a thing is in operation or
       maintenance phase, its firmware or software may be updated to
       allow for new functionality or new features.  An attacker may be
       able to exploit such a firmware upgrade by replacing the thing's
       software with malicious software, thereby influencing the
       operational behavior of the thing.  For example, an attacker
       could add a piece of malicious code to the firmware that will
       cause it to periodically report the energy usage of the lamp to a
       data repository for analysis.  Similarly, devices whose software
       has not been properly maintained and updated might contain
       vulnerabilities that might be exploited by attackers.

   6.  Extraction of private information: in the ambient environment the
       things (such as sensors, actuators, etc.) are usually physically
       unprotected and could easily be captured by an attacker.  Such an
       attacker may then attempt to extract private information such as



Garcia-Morchon, et al.    Expires June 15, 2019                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                IoT Security                 December 2018


       keys (e.g., device's key, private-key, group key), sensed data
       (e.g., healthcare status of a user), configuration parameters
       (e.g., the WiFi key), or proprietary algorithms (e.g., algorithm
       performing some data analytic task) from this thing.  Compromise
       of a thing's unique key compromises communication channels of
       this particular thing and also compromise all data communicated
       over this channel.

   7.  Routing attack: As highlighted in [ID-Daniel], routing
       information in IoT can be spoofed, altered, or replayed, in order
       to create routing loops, attract/repel network traffic, extend/
       shorten source routes, etc.  Other relevant routing attacks
       include 1) Sinkhole attack (or blackhole attack), where an
       attacker declares himself to have a high-quality route/path to
       the base station, thus allowing him to do manipulate all packets
       passing through it. 2) Selective forwarding, where an attacker
       may selectively forward packets or simply drop a packet. 3)
       Wormhole attack, where an attacker may record packets at one
       location in the network and tunnel them to another location,
       thereby influencing perceived network behavior and potentially
       distorting statistics, thus greatly impacting the functionality
       of routing. 4) Sybil attack, whereby an attacker presents
       multiple identities to other things in the network.

   8.  Privacy threat: The tracking of a thing's location and usage may
       pose a privacy risk to its users.  An attacker can infer
       information based on the information gathered about individual
       things, thus deducing behavioral patterns of the user of interest
       to him.  Such information can subsequently be sold to interested
       parties for marketing purposes and targeted advertising.

   9.  Denial-of-Service attack: Typically, things have tight memory and
       limited computation, they are thus vulnerable to resource
       exhaustion attack.  Attackers can continuously send requests to
       be processed by specific things so as to deplete their resources.
       This is especially dangerous in the IoTs since an attacker might
       be located in the backend and target resource-constrained devices
       in an Low-Latency Network (LLN).  Additionally, DoS attack can be
       launched by physically jamming the communication channel, thus
       breaking down the T2T communication channel.  Network
       availability can also be disrupted by flooding the network with a
       large number of packets.  On the other hand, things compromised
       by attackers can be used to disrupt the operation of other
       networks or systems by means of a Distributed DoS attack.

   The following table summarizes the above generic security threats and
   the potential point of vulnerabilities at different layers of the
   communication stack.  We also include related RFCs and ongoing

6.  Designing and operating secure IoT systems

   [ToDo: This section should describe how an IoT system should be
   designed/operated.  The text below is from the old draft and it
   should be further improved.]

   Dealing with above threats and finding suitable security mitigations
   is challenging: there are very sophisticated threats that a very
   powerful attacker could use; also, new threats and exploits appear in
   a daily basis.  Therefore, the existence of proper secure product
   creation processes that allow managing and minimizing risks during
   the lifecycle of the IoT devices is at least as important as being
   aware of the threats.  A non-exhaustive list of relevant processes
   include:

   1.  A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) assesses the consequences of
       loss of basic security attributes, namely, confidentiality,
       integrity and availability in an IoT system.  These consequences
       might include impact on data lost, sales lost, increased
       expenses, regulatory fines, customer dissatisfaction, etc.
       Performing a business impact analysis allow determining the
       business relevance of having a proper security design placing
       security in the focus.

   2.  A Risk Assessment (RA) analyzes security threats to the IoT
       system, considering their likelihood and impact, and deriving for
       each of them a risk level.  Risks classified as moderate or high
       must be mitigated, i.e., security architecture should be able to
       deal with that threat bringing the risk to a low level.  Note
       that threats are usually classified according to their goal:
       confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  For instance, a
       specific threat to recover a symmetric-key used in the system
       relates to confidentiality.

   3.  A privacy impact assessment (PIA) aims at assessing Personal
       Identifiable Information (PII) that is collected, processed, or
       used in the IoT system.  By doing so, the goals is to fulfill
       applicable legal requirements, determine risks and effects of the
       manipulation of PII, and evaluate proposed protections.

   4.  Procedures for incident reporting and mitigation refer to the
       methodologies that allow becoming aware of any security issues
       that affect an IoT system.  Furthermore, this includes steps
       towards the actual deployment of patches that mitigate the
       identified vulnerabilities.

   BIA, RA, and PIA are usually to be realized during the creation of a
   new IoT system, introduction of new technologies in the IoT system,

   or deployment of significant system upgrades.  In general, it is
   recommended to re-assess them on a regular basis taking into account
   new use cases or threats.

7.  Security Profiles

   ToDo: this section should contain the security profiles.  My thinking
   is to (i) define some classes of IoT systems that are illustrative of
   real-world scenarios describing the features of those (lifecycle,
   device capabilities, IoT system).  Then, (ii) describe the types of
   threats that would be typically applicable to them.  And finally,
   (iii) describe mitigation strategies that should be used to deal with
   those threats while taking into account the features of the IoT
   system.

   NOTE THAT THE 4 PROFILES ARE MERE PLACEHOLDERS.

   The text below is old and belongs to the old draft.  Part of the text
   could be reused.

   There is a wide range of IoT applications including building
   automation systems, healthcare, smart cities, logistics, etc.  For
   each of these applications, properties such as device capability,
   network infrastructure, or available security services can be
   completely different.  Furthermore, each of those applications is
   featured by a different number of actors deployed in very different
   environments and with very different purposes.

   Consequently, when a Business Impact Analysis or Risk Assessment is
   performed, not only the types of threats will be different, but also
   their likelihood and potential impact.  This determines that
   different applications tend to require different or complementary
   types of security mechanisms mitigating the identified risks.

   For example, IoT applications may have different needs regarding
   authentication and confidentiality.  While some application might not
   require any confidentiality at all, others might require strong end-
   to-end confidentiality.  In terms of secure bootstrapping of keys,
   some applications might assume the existence and online availability
   of a central key-distribution-center (KDC) within the network to
   distribute and manage keys; while other applications cannot rely on
   such a central party or on their availability.

   This section describes some exemplary security profiles fitting the
   security needs of applications with the same characteristics and
   requirements.  This approach is similar to that in the security
   profiles in [nist_lightweight_project].  Such security profiles can
   help to (i) guide the design process of different application types
   by identifying open gaps; (ii) allow for later interoperability; and
   (iii) prevent possible security misconfiguration.  Each security
   profile is identified by:

   1.  a short description,

   2.  an exemplary application that might use/require such a security
       profile,

   3.  the security requirements for each of the above security aspects
       according to our classification.

   These security profiles can serve to guide the standardization
   process, since these explicitly describe the basic functionalities
   and protocols required to get different use cases up and running.
   They can allow for later interoperability since different
   manufacturers can describe the implemented security profile in their
   products.  Finally, the security profiles can avoid possible security
   misconfiguration, since each security profile can be bound to a

   different application domain so that security protocols are clearly
   defined and under which circumstances they are applied.

   We compare the security capabilities in each of the security profiles
   according to security building blocks, namely:

   1.  Security architecture,

   2.  Security model,

   3.  Security bootstrapping,

   4.  Network security, and

   5.  Application security.

   IMPORTANT: Note that each of these exemplary profiles aims at
   summarizing the required security requirements for different
   exemplary application areas and at providing a set of initial
   security features.  In other words, these profiles reflect the need
   for different security configurations, depending on the threat and
   trust models of the underlying applications.  In this sense, this
   section does not provide an overview of existing protocols as done in
   previous sections, but it rather explicitly describes what should be
   in place to ensure secure system operation.  Observe also that this
   list of security profiles is not exhaustive and that it should be
   considered just as an example not related to existing legal
   regulations for any existing application.

   The remainder of this section is organized as follows.  The following
   section first describes four generic security profiles and discuss
   how different applications of IP networks, e.g., 6LoWPAN/CoAP
   networks, involve different security needs.  The following five
   subsections summarize the expected security features or capabilities
   for each the security profile with regards to "Security
   Architecture", "Security Model", "Security Bootstrapping", "Network
   Security", and "Application Security".

7.1.  Classes of IoT Systems

   ToDo: This section should describe some exemplary classes of IoT
   systems.  As already said above, my thinking would be to describe the
   features of those systems and also the typical threat model for each
   of those classes of IoT systems.  With this, we can also 'assign'
   mitigation strategies to each of the classes of IoT systems and that
   set of mitigation strategies would be the security profile.

   The text below is from the old draft.

   We consider four generic security profiles as summarized in the table
   below:

  +----------+-----------------+---------------------------------------+

            Figure 3: Security profiles and application areas.

   The classification in the table considers different potential
   applications in which security mechanism are chosen according to the
   operational features (network size, existence of a central device,
   connectivity to the Internet, importance of the exchanged
   information, etc.) and threat model (what are the assets that an
   attacker looks for).  As already pointed out, this set of scenarios
   is just exemplary and they should be further discussed based on a
   broader consensus.

   The security suite (SecProf_1) is catered for environments in which
   IP protocols (e.g., 6LoWPAN/CoAP) can be used to enable communication
   between things in an ad-hoc manner and the security requirements are
   minimal.  An example, is a home application in which two devices
   should exchange information and no further connection with other
   devices (local or with a backend) is required.  In this scenario,
   value of the exchanged information is low and usually happens in a
   confined room, thus, it is possible to have a short period of time
   during which initial secrets can be exchanged in the clear.  Due to
   this fact, there is no requirement to enable devices from different
   manufacturers to inter operate in a secure way (keys are just
   exchanged).  The expected network size of applications using this
   profile is expected to be small such that the provision of network
   security, e.g., secure routing, is of low importance.



Garcia-Morchon, et al.    Expires June 15, 2019                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                IoT Security                 December 2018


   The next security suite (SecProf_2) represents an evolution of
   SecProf_1 in which, e.g., home devices, can be managed.  A first
   possibility for the securing domain management refers to the creation
   of a centrally managed security domain without any connectivity to
   the Internet.  The central device used for management can serve as,
   e.g., a key distribution center including policies for key update,
   storage, etc.  The presence of a central device can help in the
   management of larger networks.  Network security becomes more
   relevant in this scenario since the IP network (e.g., 6LoWPAN/CoAP
   network) can be prone to Denial of Service attacks (e.g., flooding if
   L2 is not protected) or routing attacks.  Similarly, the network of
   devices could also be the source of a DDoS attack and a central
   device connecting to the Internet can block traffic of ongoing
   attacks.

   SecProf_3 considers that a central device is always required for
   managing the system.  Example applications of this profile include
   building control and automation, sensor networks for industrial use,
   environmental monitoring, etc.  As before, the manager can be located
   in the same network (e.g., 6LoWPAN/CoAP network) and handle key
   management.  In this case, the first association of devices to the
   network is required to be done in a secure way, i.e., requiring
   authentication and authorization.  This step can involve the secure
   transmission of keying materials used for network security at
   different layers.  The information exchanged in the network is
   considered to be valuable and it should be protected in the sense of
   pairwise links.  Commands should be secured and broadcast should be
   secured with entity authentication [RFC7390].  Network should be
   protected from routing attacks.  A further extension to this use case
   is to allow for remote management.  A "backend manager" is in charge
   of securely managing SW or information exchanged or collected within
   the network, e.g., a 6LoWPAN/CoAP network.  This requires connection
   of devices to the Internet over a 6LBR involving a number of new
   threats that were not present before.  A list of potential attacks
   include: resource-exhaustion attacks from the Internet; amplification
   attacks; trust issues related a HTTP-CoAP proxy [ID-proHTTPCoAP],
   etc.  This use case requires protecting the communication from a
   device in the backend to a device in the IP network, e.g., a 6LoWPAN/
   CoAP network, end-to-end.  This use case also requires measures to
   provide the 6LBR with the capability of dropping fake requests coming
   from the Internet.  This becomes especially challenging when the 6LBR
   is not trusted and access to the exchanged information is limited;
   and even more in the case of a HTTP-CoAP proxy since protocol
   translation is required.  This use case should take care of
   protecting information accessed from the backend due to privacy
   issues (e.g., information such as type of devices, location, usage,
   type and amount of exchanged information, or mobility patterns can be

   gathered at the backend threatening the privacy sphere of users) so
   that only required information is disclosed.

   The last security suite (SecProf_4) essentially represents
   interoperability of all the security profiles defined previously.  It
   considers applications with some additional requirements regarding
   operation such as: (i) ad-hoc establishment of security relationships
   between things (potentially from different manufacturers) in non-
   secure environments or (ii) dynamic roaming of things between
   different IP network security domains.  Such operational requirements
   pose additional security requirements, e.g., in addition to secure
   bootstrapping of a device within an IP, e.g., 6LowPan/CoAP, security
   domain and the secure transfer of network operational key, there is a
   need to enable inter-domains secure communication to facilitate data
   sharing.  In this scenario, there is also a higher pressure to ensure
   that an attacker cannot compromise deployed devices and extract or
   modify any type of private data such as cryptographic keys, data, or
   proprietary algorithms.
